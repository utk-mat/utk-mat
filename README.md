### üé® My Key Projects

This section highlights some of my most notable projects. Each project has a detailed README in its repository, which I encourage you to explore for a deeper understanding.

#### 1. Flower Simulation (IIT P Project) üå∏

*This project is a sophisticated **Federated Learning (FL) framework** designed to train neural networks on decentralized data. It uses **Flower** for orchestration and **Hydra** for flexible configuration, simulating real-world scenarios where data cannot be shared. The framework trains a CNN on the MNIST dataset across multiple clients, saving all metrics and configurations for easy reproducibility.*

- **Problem:** Training a single, powerful model from data distributed across many different sources without ever seeing or centralizing the raw data.
- **Solution:** A federated learning system that orchestrates secure, collaborative training.
- **Visual Diagram:** ![Flower Simulation Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/r6bK5jE.png)
- **Tech Stack:** `Python` `Flower` `Hydra` `PyTorch` `YAML`

#### 2. LeetCode AI Assistant ü§ñ

*A lightweight and elegant **Chrome extension** that provides real-time, **AI-powered coding assistance** directly on LeetCode problem pages. This assistant uses the **OpenAI API** to help users with problem analysis, code suggestions, solution explanations, and code optimization, all from an unobtrusive floating icon.*

- **Problem:** The need for a simple, non-disruptive way to get AI assistance for LeetCode problems without switching tabs or complex interfaces.
- **Solution:** A minimalist Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates into the LeetCode environment.
- **Visual Diagram:** ![LeetCode AI Assistant Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/L1Q8B5j.png)
- **Tech Stack:** `JavaScript` `OpenAI API` `Chrome Extension API`

#### 3. BloodChain AI ‚ù§Ô∏è

*This **winning hackathon project** is a **privacy-preserving blood donation management system**. It tackles a critical healthcare problem by combining **Federated Learning** for collaborative AI training without data sharing, **Homomorphic Encryption** for secure computation on encrypted data, and **Blockchain** for immutable transaction logging. The system was deployed on **Azure** and demonstrated significant improvements in privacy and efficiency.*

- **Problem:** How to use patient data from multiple hospitals to train a powerful AI model for risk assessment and donor matching without compromising patient privacy.
- **Solution:** A secure, multi-layered system that keeps data local to hospitals while allowing for collaborative AI training.
- **Visual Diagram:** ![BloodChain AI Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/8Qj85vT.png)
- **Tech Stack:** `Python` `PyTorch` `Flask` `Tensorflow` `Blockchain` `Azure` `TenSEAL`

#### 4. Greywater IoT ML üíß

*A machine learning project providing a comprehensive **baseline for water quality classification** for IoT-based greywater filtration. Using the Kaggle Water Potability dataset as a proxy, it trains and evaluates **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models. The project includes a guide for adapting this model to real-time IoT sensor data for predicting when a greywater filter needs maintenance, with a focus on producing publication-ready results and visualizations.*

- **Problem:** Predicting the maintenance needs of an IoT-based greywater filtration system using sensor data.
- **Solution:** A machine learning pipeline that establishes a performance baseline for water quality classification and provides a clear mapping for future IoT sensor integration.
- **Visual Diagram:** ![Greywater IoT ML Pipeline Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/2YcW9kF.png)
- **Tech Stack:** `Python` `Scikit-learn` `Pandas` `Numpy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn`

#### 5. Tresata Classifier üìä

*This project is a **two-stage data processing pipeline** designed for intelligent data classification and parsing. **Stage 1** uses a **Random Forest model** to classify data into categories like `phone`, `company`, or `date`, with detailed confidence scoring. **Stage 2** then parses the classified data to extract structured information, such as country codes from phone numbers or legal suffixes from company names. A Gemini API fallback is also included for comparison.*

- **Problem:** Automatically categorizing and extracting structured information from a variety of messy, unstructured data.
- **Solution:** A robust two-stage pipeline that first classifies data using a high-performance ML model and then applies a specialized parser for extraction.
- **Visual Diagram:** ![Tresata Classifier Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/3c8E73q.png)
- **Tech Stack:** `Python` `Scikit-learn` `Pandas` `Joblib` `Gemini API`

#### 6. JournalApp ‚úçÔ∏è

*A simple but functional **journal application** built in **Java**. It provides a foundational framework for users to create, read, update, and delete personal journal entries. The project is structured using **Maven** for dependency management, making it easy to build and extend. This serves as a solid base for a more feature-rich productivity application.*

- **Problem:** The need for a straightforward, local application for managing personal journal entries.
- **Solution:** A basic command-line or GUI application in Java that handles the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for journal entries.
- **Tech Stack:** `Java` `Maven`

#### 7. Other Projects

* My other projects include a simple car racing game built with Python and Pygame (`Car-Game`) and a personal Digital KYC App prototype built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS (`Digital KYC App`). You can find them all on my profile!
