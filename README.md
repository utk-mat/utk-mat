## 🎨 My Key Projects

This section highlights some of my most notable projects. Each project has a detailed README in its repository, which I encourage you to explore for a deeper understanding.

***

### 1. Flower Simulation (IIT P Project) 🌸

A sophisticated **Federated Learning (FL) framework** that trains neural networks on decentralized data. It uses **Flower** for orchestration and **Hydra** for flexible configuration, simulating real-world scenarios where data cannot be shared. The framework trains a CNN on the MNIST dataset across multiple clients, saving all metrics and configurations for easy reproducibility.

- **Problem:** Training a single, powerful model from data distributed across many different sources without ever seeing or centralizing the raw data.
- **Solution:** A federated learning system that orchestrates secure, collaborative training.
- **Architecture Diagram:**

### 2. LeetCode AI Assistant 🤖

A lightweight and elegant **Chrome extension** that provides real-time, **AI-powered coding assistance** directly on LeetCode problem pages. This assistant uses the **OpenAI API** to help users with problem analysis, code suggestions, solution explanations, and code optimization, all from an unobtrusive floating icon.

- **Problem:** The need for a simple, non-disruptive way to get AI assistance for LeetCode problems without switching tabs or complex interfaces.
- **Solution:** A minimalist Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates into the LeetCode environment.

### 3. BloodChain AI ❤️

This **winning hackathon project** is a **privacy-preserving blood donation management system**. It tackles a critical healthcare problem by combining **Federated Learning** for collaborative AI training without data sharing, **Homomorphic Encryption** for secure computation on encrypted data, and **Blockchain** for immutable transaction logging. The system was deployed on **Azure** and demonstrated significant improvements in privacy and efficiency.

- **Problem:** How to use patient data from multiple hospitals to train a powerful AI model for risk assessment and donor matching without compromising patient privacy.
- **Solution:** A secure, multi-layered system that keeps data local to hospitals while allowing for collaborative AI training.

### 4. Greywater IoT ML 💧

A machine learning project providing a comprehensive **baseline for water quality classification** for IoT-based greywater filtration. Using the Kaggle Water Potability dataset as a proxy, it trains and evaluates **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models. The project includes a guide for adapting this model to real-time IoT sensor data for predicting when a greywater filter needs maintenance, with a focus on producing publication-ready results and visualizations.

- **Problem:** Predicting the maintenance needs of an IoT-based greywater filtration system using sensor data.
- **Solution:** A machine learning pipeline that establishes a performance baseline for water quality classification and provides a clear mapping for future IoT sensor integration.

### 5. Tresata Classifier 📊

An intelligent classifier that automatically detects **column types** in CSVs and performs parsing + normalization. This project is a **two-stage data processing pipeline** designed for data classification and structured data extraction. **Stage 1** uses a **Random Forest model** to classify data into categories like `phone`, `company`, or `date`, with detailed confidence scoring. **Stage 2** then parses the classified data to extract structured information, such as country codes from phone numbers or legal suffixes from company names.

- **Problem:** Automatically categorizing and extracting structured information from a variety of messy, unstructured data.
- **Solution:** A robust two-stage pipeline that first classifies data using a high-performance ML model and then applies a specialized parser for extraction.

### 6. Journal App ✍️

A simple but functional **journal application** built in **Java**. It provides a foundational framework for users to create, read, update, and delete personal journal entries. The project is structured using **Maven** for dependency management, making it easy to build and extend.

- **Problem:** The need for a straightforward, local application for managing personal journal entries.
- **Solution:** A basic command-line or GUI application in Java that handles the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for journal entries.
